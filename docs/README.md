# The Kentucky Open Source Society (KYOSS)

## Welcome

The KY Open Source Society is a community of enthusiasts, knowledge
seekers, professionals, amateurs, and anyone else who has an interest
in Open Source software and Open Source philosophies.

## Meetings

We meet in-person on the 2nd Wednesday of each month:

* 6:30pm US Eastern time
* [700 N Hurstbourne Pkwy, Louisville, KY, 40222
  USA](https://goo.gl/maps/eoeeP7YbLnpqShuaA)
* First floor: the 700 room
  * You can walk in either entrance to the building; the conference
    room is on the same floor as the entrace doors.
  * The conference room is easy to find: it has floor-to-ceiling glass
    walls and glass doors.

We tend to have one or two scheduled presentations, and there is
generally lots of open questions and discussion.  Beginners and experts
are welcome!
