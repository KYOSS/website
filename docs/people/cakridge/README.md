# Chris Akridge

Hi! I'm Chris, and I work as a junior software developer at e-PulseTrak.com on behalf of Bill Collins Ford Lincoln of Louisville. We're building an online car-buying website using C# and React, using Vue and TypeScript on the administration site.

I'm a bit of an odd-one-out in KYOSS - I'm a Windows user and a fan of C# and .NET, but I've always admired Linux and the Linux kernel, along with the myriad open-source tools. I work on a number of eccentric hobby projects - I've written a simple compiler for a C-like language and am currently doing an unnecessary project where I recursively decompile, disassemble, and decompress every file on all my machines. No, I'm not sure why, either.
