## ASCIInema

ASCIInema is a command-line tool which allows the user to record interactions and outputs in a ANSI compatible terminal. When you run asciinema rec in your terminal the recording starts, capturing all output that is being printed to your terminal while youâ€™re issuing the shell commands. When the recording finishes (by hitting Ctrl-D or typing exit) then the captured output is uploaded to asciinema.org website and prepared for playback on the web by default.

### Installation

#### On Fedora
```
sudo dnf install -y asciinema
```

#### On Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install -y asciinema
```

#### With Homebrew
```
brew install asciinema
```

### Usage

#### Record and upload to asciinema.org

```
asciinema rec
```

#### Record to local cast file

```
asciinema rec path/to/output.cast
```

#### Adding a title

```
asciinema rec path/to/output.cast -t 'My super cool CLI recording'
```

### Publishing To The Web

You can also record to a local file and add that file to your own web site using the asciinema-player JavaScript and CSS modules. I have added those capabilities to the KYOSS VuePress site for this purpose. By recording to a local `cast` file, you can then place that file in `docs/.vuepress/public/casts` and reference it using the asciinema component I added for VuePress as shown below:

```
<asciinema :src="$withBase('/casts/2022-december-asciinema.cast')" cols=120 rows=30 />
```

This results in the following:

<asciinema :src="$withBase('/casts/2022-december-asciinema.cast')" cols=120 rows=30 />

### Some Considerations

Some things to keep in mind. If you are using, as I am, custom fonts for your terminal you will need to add those custom fonts to your web site using CSS as we see in the snippets from the ASCIInema CSS I customized below:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: OverpassMonoNF;
  src: url('/fonts/Overpass_Mono_NerdFont.otf') format('opentype');
}

}
